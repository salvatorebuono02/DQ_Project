# Data Quality Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated **data pollution**
function designed to introduce variable type errors into a given dataset. These
errors will extend various data types, including categorical, numeric, and boolean
types. By injecting these intentional inaccuracies, we aim to assess and analyze the
robustness and resilience of different regression algorithms when confronted with
such data pollution.

The data pollution function will be meticulously crafted to simulate real-world
scenarios where datasets may be prone to inaccuracies or inconsistencies in vari-
able types. This intentional introduction of errors will allow us to evaluate the
perfomance, speed and overfitting of **regression algorithms** in handling diverse data
scenarios.
